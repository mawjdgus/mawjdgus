# How to implement a YOLO(v3) object detector from scratch in PyTorch: Part2

This is Part 2 of the tutorial on implementing a YOLO v3 detector from scratch. In the last part, I explained how YOLO works, and in this part, we are going to implement the layers used by YOLO in PyTorch.
In other words, this is the part where we create the building blocks of our model.

The code for this tutorial is designed to run on Python 3.5 and PyTorch 0.4. It can be found in it's entirety.
